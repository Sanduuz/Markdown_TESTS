Here are the steps for reproduction:

| ![kitten.png](./attachments/kitten.png) |
|:---:|
| This is a working image of a cat |

| ![kitten.png](./attachments/kitten.png) |
|:---:|
| This is a broken image of a cat because of math symbols $x_n$ |
Note: The image does not break due to math symbols not being supported in bug-reports at the moment. If you would upload this as a markdown file into a repository, the image would be broken.

> The same goes with blockquotes. Here is a working image of a cat:
> ![kitten.png](./attachments/kitten.png)
> Renders just fine

> But if I have math symbols in:
> ![kitten.png](./attachments/kitten.png)
> The image breaks $x_n$
> Note: The image does not break due to math symbols not being supported in bug-reports at the moment. If you would upload this as a markdown file into a repository, the image would be broken.
